Backend developer:
- Use NodeJS to develop a Restful API to:
    - Add/Edit/Delete contacts
    - Retrieve all contacts
    - Search for a contact
- Assumptions:
    - Use any framework or library of your choice.
    - Use in-memory data storage - no need implement connections to a DB.
    - You will receive an auth token in the request header ‘Authorisation’ field for authentication with value ‘MY_SECRET_ENCRYPTED_TOKEN’. Use this token to authenticate the user.
    - Single contact details:
        - Name
        - Email
        - Phone(s) - can add more than one phone number
        - UserID - Authenticated user
- What we look for:
    - Clean and readable code
    - Modular code base with good project hierarchy
    - Testable code
    - Well organised git commits in small chunks
- Deliverables:
    - ReadMe that includes installation, running instructions and any other assumptions you have made.
    - Git repository for your solution.
    - Add the username “sokkary” as a collaborator to your git project repository, then create a “Pull request” contains your code and assign “sokkary” as a reviewer.
- Duration:
    - Time box your task to 1 ~ 2 hours.
